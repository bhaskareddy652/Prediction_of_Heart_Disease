## Heart Disease Prediction - Dataset Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The dataset includes several features that provide insights into the patient's health status. The prediction target is whether a patient has heart disease (Positive or Negative).

Dataset Description

Features (X)

Age: Continuous (numeric) - The age of the patient.

Sex: Binary (1 = Male, 0 = Female) - The gender of the patient.

Chest Pain Type (cp): Ordinal (4 values)

  1: Typical angina
  
  2: Atypical angina
  
  3: Non-anginal pain
  
  4: Asymptomatic

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): Continuous (numeric) - Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).

Serum Cholesterol (chol): Continuous (numeric) - Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl).

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): Binary (1 = true, 0 = false) - Fasting blood sugar level (> 120 mg/dl).

Resting Electrocardiography Results (restecg): Ordinal (Values: 0, 1, 2)

  0: Normal
  
  1: Having ST-T wave abnormality
  
  2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): Continuous (numeric) - Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.

Exercise Induced Angina (exang): Binary (1 = yes, 0 = no) - Exercise-induced angina.

ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak): Continuous (numeric) - ST depression caused by exercise compared to rest.

Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope): Ordinal

  1: Upsloping
  
  2: Flat
  
  3: Downsloping

Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca): Ordinal (0-3) - Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.

Thalassemia (thal): Ordinal

  3: Normal
  
  6: Fixed defect
  
  7: Reversible defect
